<p>On 21<sup>st</sup> October 2024, Safe Sport and the People’s Association
(PA) jointly conducted an Awareness Workshop for PA’s trainers. A total
of 29 trainers participated in the session, gaining critical insights into
recognising abuse and harassment, maintaining professional boundaries,
and upholding proper conduct.</p>
<p>Participants explored realistic scenarios to deepen their understanding
of creating safe and supportive learning environments. These discussions
empowered them with the skills and confidence to ensure that all students
feel respected and valued within the community.</p>
<p>The workshop also provided a valuable platform for trainers to share best
practices and foster peer learning. Through this collaborative effort,
we are proud to support trainers in becoming champions of Safe Sport values,
ensuring a positive and inclusive experience for all learners.</p>
