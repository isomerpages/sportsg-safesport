<p>The Safe Sport team was delighted to participate in SUTD Health and Safety
Day on 12 March 2025, where we conducted an interactive workshop and hosted
an engagement booth about safeguarding in sport. Through real-life case
discussions, activities, and gamified learning, participants gained valuable
insights into creating safer sporting environments.</p>
<h4><strong>Interactive Workshop: Learning Through Real-World Scenarios</strong></h4>
<p>The workshop engaged participants in real-life case studies, encouraging
them to analyse situations and discuss best practices for ensuring athlete
safety and well-being. By exploring different forms of misconduct and ethical
dilemmas, attendees were able to better understand the importance of Safe
Sport principles and their role in fostering a safe, respectful, and inclusive
sporting culture.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>"The discussions leant perspective to what a safe environment could look like for different sports, and the avenues to report or get help"</em>
</p>

<h4><strong>Gamified Learning at the Engagement Booth</strong></h4>
<p>Believing that learning should be both interactive and enjoyable, we introduced
a self-made, recycled gachapon machine, bringing a fun twist to Safe Sport
education. Each capsule contained a question related to the <a href="https://www.safesport.sg/safe-sport-programme/unified-code/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Safe Sport Unified Code</a>,
prompting participants to refer to the Code to find the correct answer.
This activity not only reinforced key learning points but also encouraged
greater familiarity with Safe Sport guidelines. As an added incentive,
participants received a small giveaway for every correct response.</p>

<h4><strong>Exploring Bystander Roles with the Upstander Test</strong></h4>
<p>Another highlight of the booth was the <a href="https://play.solstice.sg/safesport/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Upstander Test</a>, where participants
discovered their upstander profile—Captain Courage, Blasé Benchwarmer,
or Reserved Referee. This activity encouraged self-reflection on how individuals
respond to misconduct and emphasised the importance of being an active
upstander in promoting Safe Sport values.</p>
<p></p>
<p>From&nbsp;engagement to education, SUTD Health and Safety Day was a fantastic
opportunity to spark conversations, challenge perspectives, and champion
the&nbsp;<strong>Safe Sport Movement</strong>.</p>
