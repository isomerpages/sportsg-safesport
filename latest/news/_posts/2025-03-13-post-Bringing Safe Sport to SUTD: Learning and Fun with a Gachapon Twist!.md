<p><strong>Bringing Safe Sport to SUTD Safety Day: Learning, Fun with A Gashapon Twist!</strong>
</p>
<p>The Safe Sport team was delighted to participate in SUTD Health and Safety
Day on 12 March, where we conducted an interactive workshop and hosted
an engagement booth to raise awareness about safeguarding in sport. Through
real-life case discussions, interactive activities, and gamified learning,
participants gained valuable insights into creating safer sporting environments.</p>

</p>
<p><strong><em>Interactive Workshop: Learning Through Real-World Scenarios</em></strong>
</p>
<p>The workshop engaged participants in real-life case studies, encouraging
them to analyse situations and discuss best practices for ensuring athlete
safety and well-being. By exploring different forms of misconduct and ethical
dilemmas, attendees were able to better understand the importance of Safe
Sport principles and their role in fostering a safe, respectful, and inclusive
sporting culture.</p>

<p><strong><em>Gamified Learning at the Engagement Booth</em></strong>
</p>
<p>To make learning both interactive and enjoyable, we introduced a self-made,
recycled gashapon machine, bringing a fun twist to Safe Sport education.
Each capsule contained a question related to the Safe Sport Unified Code,
prompting participants to refer to the Code to find the correct answer.
This activity not only reinforced key learning points but also encouraged
greater familiarity with Safe Sport guidelines. As an added incentive,
participants received a small giveaway for every correct response.</p>

<p><strong><em>Exploring Bystander Roles with the Upstander Test</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Another highlight of the booth was the Upstander Test, where participants
discovered their upstander profile—whether they were a Captain Courage,
a Blasé Benchwarmer, or a Reserved Referee. This activity encouraged self-reflection
on how individuals respond to situations involving misconduct and emphasised
the importance of being an active upstander in promoting Safe Sport values.</p>

<p>From&nbsp;engagement to education, SUTD Health and Safety Day was a fantastic
opportunity to spark conversations, challenge perspectives, and champion
the&nbsp;<strong>Safe Sport movement</strong>.</p>
