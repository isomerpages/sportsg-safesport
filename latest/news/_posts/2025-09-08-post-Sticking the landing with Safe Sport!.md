<p>On 8<sup>th</sup> September 2025, the Safe Sport team delivered a workshop
on psychological safety at Singapore Gymnastics’ coach congress. The annual
congress is open to all gymnastics coaches and sports education practitioners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our workshop shared how psychologically safe environments enable athletes
to reach their full potential by fostering open communication and athlete
empowerment. Real-life examples were shared on how psychologically abusive
coaching practices lead to athletes turning away from the sport.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Participants reflected on their current practices and assessed where they
stood in implementing psychological safety principles. Breakout sessions
allowed coaches to share experiences and learn from diverse perspectives
within the gymnastics community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The collaborative discussions helped participants gain new insights into
different coaching approaches and identify strategies for building stronger,
more trusting relationships with their athletes. Some of the practices
that the coaches are already doing are, “allowing their athletes to suggest
exercises to try and explore”, “allowing them to speak their minds” and
“having reflective time for them to look into areas to improve on”, just
to name a few.</p>

<p>The workshop reflects Singapore Gymnastics' commitment to supporting athletes
both technically and psychologically through safer sporting environments.
Opportunities to work with coaches help us build stronger Safe Sport practices
and foster environments where all athletes feel included, supported, and
protected.</p>
