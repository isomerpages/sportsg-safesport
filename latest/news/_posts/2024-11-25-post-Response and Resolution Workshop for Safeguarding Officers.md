<p>On 18 November 2024, the Safe Sport team hosted an engaging face-to-face
Response and Resolution workshop for trained Safeguarding Officers (SOs)
from various member organisations.</p>
<p>The session saw the participation of 17 SOs and aimed to address challenges,
questions, or uncertainties the participants might have had about dealing
with matters as SOs.</p>
<p>The workshop began with a check-in activity, where participants assessed
their confidence in handling a safeguarding case. The responses received
varied in scale. Participants were then divided into small groups of three
to four, tasked with two case studies and discussed how they would handle
both situations. Members of the Safe Sport team facilitated the smaller
groups. The case studies were loosely based on real matters that the Safe
Sport team had tended to under its Case Management wing.</p>
<p>Ms. Ong Kai Fen, Assistant Director at the Singapore Sports School, also
attended the workshop to share her valuable insights and experiences as
a Safeguarding Officer. Her participation added a real-world perspective,
as she provided practical tips and reassurance to the group. Ms. Ong acknowledged
that while the role of a Safeguarding Officer is not without its challenges,
the sense of fulfilment that comes from successfully resolving cases makes
it all worthwhile. Her words offered encouragement and emphasised the importance
of perseverance and commitment in safeguarding efforts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Prior to Ms Ongâ€™s segment, a reflection activity was conducted, where
participants were asked to re-assess their confidence in handling a case
after completing the group work on the case studies. Much to the delight
of the Safe Sport team, the responses indicated a broad range of confidence
levels among the participants. This range of responses was encouraging,
as it highlighted the potential for growth in safeguarding skills.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Many participants expressed that they found the workshop highly beneficial,
while some requested the inclusion of additional case studies in future
session. Overall, the feedback was overwhelmingly positive.&nbsp; Encouraged
by this, the Safe Sport team is committed to supporting SOs in their roles
and providing avenues for development. Many thanks to the SOs who attended
and made the session so lively with their active participation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
