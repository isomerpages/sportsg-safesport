<p>The session saw the participation of 17 SOs and aimed to address challenges,
questions, or uncertainties the participants might have had about dealing
with matters as SOs. The participants faced 2 case scenarios, and discussed
in groups how they would handle the situation in real life.</p>
<p>Ms. Ong Kai Fen, Assistant Director at the Singapore Sports School, shared
her valuable insights and experiences, adding a real-world perspective
and provided practical tips. Ms. Ong acknowledged that while the role of
a Safeguarding Officer is not without its challenges, the sense of fulfilment
that comes from successfully resolving cases makes it all worthwhile. Her
words offered encouragement and emphasised the importance of perseverance
and commitment in safeguarding efforts.</p>
