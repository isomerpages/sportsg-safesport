at Bukit Merah Community Hub for a 1.5-day Restorative Practices (RP) workshop,
organised by Lutheran Community Care Services (LCCS). The workshop brought

Singapore Sports School and other various organisations – all eager to
discover how RP can build stronger relationships and strengthen communities!</p>

<p>RP is about&nbsp;accountability, empathy, and teamwork. One of the most
powerful parts of the workshop?&nbsp;Restorative Practice Circles—guided
discussions that created a safe space for honest conversations, conflict
resolution, and deeper connections. As one participant put it,&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I really enjoyed the workshop! It has given me more confidence to both strengthen and repair relationships in my life.”</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The workshop also highlighted how RP plays a vital role in championing
Safe Sport, reinforcing respect, trust, and inclusivity to create environments
where participants can truly thrive. One heartfelt reflection summed it
up perfectly: <em>“Thank you for the enlightenment and confidence that was given to us”</em>.
This reiterated that RP was well-received by participants.</p>

<p>With a&nbsp;hands-on, interactive approach, participants walked away equipped
with practical skills to bring back to their communities and workplaces.
By embracing restorative approaches, we are paving the way for safer, more
supportive spaces!</p>
