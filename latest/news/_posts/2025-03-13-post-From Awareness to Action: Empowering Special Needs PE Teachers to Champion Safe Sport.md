<p>Creating a safe and supportive sporting environment isn’t just about rules
- it’s about action, awareness and a shared commitment to protecting the
sporting community. &nbsp;&nbsp;This was the focus of a two-part Safe Sport
Workshop conducted with Physical Education teachers from St. Andrew’s Autism
School. Packed with discussions, real-life case scenarios, and hands-on
activities , the sessions sparked valuable conversations on safeguarding
in a special needs setting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first session introduced teachers to Safe Sport principles with an
immersive experience, diving into real-world case scenarios. Could they
spot warning signs? Would they know what to do in a tricky situation? Through
discussions, they reflected on how they would respond in such situations
while working with special needs students.
<br>A key part of the session was stepping into the role of a bystander, challenging
them to think critically about what they would do if they witnessed inappropriate
behaviour. These exercises helped teachers sharpen their instincts, &nbsp;recognise
red flags and feel more confident about their approach to ensuring the
safety and well-being of their students.</p>
<p>With the &nbsp;foundation in place, the second session focused on the
environmental risk factors of their school setting. Teachers were encouraged
to assess their activation state in safeguarding—an activity adapted from
Celia Brackenridge’s model. This eye-opening exercise revealed the gap
between their perceived readiness and actual activation state, sparking
reflections on how they could take more proactive steps to enhance safety
measures.</p>
<p>What stood out most was the energy and enthusiasm in the room. These educators
were highly sensitive and had a deep passion for safeguarding. Their dedication
to provide a safe and nurturing environment for their students was evident
throughout both sessions. Their willingness to engage, share insights,
and challenge their own perspectives – all reinforcing their deep commitment
to making sport an empowering experience for every child, regardless of
ability.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through workshops like these, we don’t just inform, but empower! By equipping
educators with the knowledge and confidence to be active guardians of Safe
Sport, we move nearer to ensure that inclusion, protection, and well-being
remain at the heart of physical education.</p>
