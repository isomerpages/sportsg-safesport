of Social Sciences (SUSS) to conduct a workshop for its peer coaches. These
students passion for sport and arts led them to form interest groups such

<p>The students learnt about Safe Sport, discussed real-life case scenarios
and shared things they had experienced or heard about in their environment.
Former national floorball captain, Fariza Zabir, spoke about her experience
as a peer leader and how the Safe Sport landscape has changed over the

<p>Extracurriculars contribute to the holistic well-being of students, helping
them make friends and keep fit. Kudos to these students for being self-starters
and for your enthusiasm in keeping your interest groups free from abuse
and harrassment.</p>
