<i> <font size="-1"> Launch of Hands Up for Safe Aquatics Campaign at OCBC Aquatic Centre </font></i>
<br><br>
Singapore Aquatics launched the Hands Up for Aquatics Campaign on 6 September 2023 to raise awareness of the types of abuse and harassment that may happen in the sporting environment.

<h4> <i> “It’s important for everyone to understand that abuse and neglect do not just come physically, as athletes also need a nurturing environment free from other forms of abuse to thrive and enjoy their sport. </i> </h4>
<b> - Vivien Tai (artistic swimming)</b>

Following the launch, Singapore Aquatics and Safe Sport Commission Singapore held a series of workshops for various stakeholders including athletes, coaches and sport administrators.
