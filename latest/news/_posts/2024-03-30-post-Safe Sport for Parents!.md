<p>Over the last two weekends, we collaborated with ActiveSG Academies and
Clubs to deliver Safe Sport webinars to parents. While children explore
new sports, it is important that parents remain vigilant to keep sport
fun.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Parents learnt about the forms of abuse and harassment, the importance
of safeguarding in sport and their duty of care in safeguarding sport.</p>
<p></p>
<p>An online study in Europe revealed that 65% of children experienced psychological
violence in sport. This includes humiliating, isolating and threatening
behaviours, which harms mental health and social development.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Children are most likely to disclose interpersonal violence in sport to
their parents. It is important to keep an open line of communication with
your child and avoid normalising or dismissing their experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>If you think your child is experiencing abuse and harassment in sport,
find out more and alert the Safe Sport Commission.</p>
<p></p>
<p>ActiveSG has eighteen Academies and Clubs, each teaching a different sport.
The sessions prioritise fun and anyone can join regardless of age or skill.</p>
