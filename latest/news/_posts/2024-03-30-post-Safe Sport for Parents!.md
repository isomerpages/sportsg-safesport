<p>Over the last two weekends, we collaborated with ActiveSG Academies and
Clubs to deliver Safe Sport webinars to parents. While children explore
new sports, it is important that parents remain vigilant to keep sport
fun.</p>

<p>Parents learnt about the forms of abuse and harassment, the importance
of safeguarding in sport and their duty of care in safeguarding sport.</p>
<p></p>
<p>An online study in Europe revealed that 65% of children experienced psychological
violence in sport. This includes humiliating, isolating and threatening
behaviours, which harms mental health and social development.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Children are most likely to disclose experiences of interpersonal violence
in sport to their parents.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em><sup>Woessner, M. N. et al. (2023)</sup></em>
</p>
<p>It is important to keep an open line of communication with your child
so they can share if something made them uncomfortable. Avoid normalising
or dismissing their experience to break cycles of violence.</p>
