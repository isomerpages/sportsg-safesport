Members of the Safe Sport Disciplinary Panel and the Safe Sport Support Network gathered to share and share thoughts and views over several topics over the weekend.

Discussions included the application of the standard of proof to incidents where conflicting accounts from primary witnesses were presented.

The members also shared and exchanged views on the application of the assessment of seriousness to circumstances of physical and psychological misconduct.

Under the Response and Resolution Process provided by the Safe Sport Programme, incidents which meet the Category B severity threshold (i.e. culpability and/or harm caused is assessed to be of medium severity) are referred to the Disciplinary Panel for hearing.

Since the appointment of the Safe Sport Disciplinary Panel by the Ministry of Community Culture and Youth in 2022, 85% of the hearings convened relate to matters of sexual misconduct and 15% relate to physical and psychological misconduct.
