<blockquote>
<p><em>“Very interactive and resourceful training!”</em>
</p>
<p><em><br>“The trainer and Safe Sport team are dedicated to making sure we have the right tools to carry out our role.”</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These were just some of the reflections shared by participants at our
recent&nbsp;Safeguarding Officer (SO) Training&nbsp;— and this time, it
went regional.</p>
<p>In a significant step towards regional collaboration, Safe Sport Commission
Singapore welcomed a delegation from&nbsp;Majlis Sukan Negara Malaysia
(MSN)&nbsp;to take part in the training. The Malaysian contingent included&nbsp;Dr.
Hjh. Yatela Zainal Abidin, Board Member of MSN and Chairperson of the <em>Jawatankuasa Salahlaku dan Perlindungan dalam Sukan</em> (Safe
Sport Committee),&nbsp;YBhg. Datuk Shalin Zulkifli, Head of the MACE Secretariat,
along with five officers from MSN.</p>

<p>The training equips participants to respond to misconduct in sport and
supported MSN’s efforts to develop their own safeguarding training content
— a meaningful stride forward in our shared ASEAN journey towards safer
sporting environment.</p>
<p>As part of the visit,&nbsp;Dr. Yatela also met with Safe Sport Commission
Singapore Chair, Ms Chan Yen San, to discuss ongoing efforts and explore
opportunities to strengthen collaboration between both countries in safeguarding
sport.</p>
