<p>The session was packed with lively discussions about recognising abuse
and harassment, setting professional boundaries, and building a positive
sporting culture.</p>
<p>A highlight of the session was hearing teachers share their experiences
supporting students with special needs, sparking meaningful conversations
on inclusivity in safeguarding.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"One thing I found useful was the different methods of handling concerning
situations"</p>
<p></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After a rich afternoon of idea-sharing, the teachers left armed with knowledge,
strategies and a shared commitment to cultivating positive and empowering
sporting experiences for all.</p>
