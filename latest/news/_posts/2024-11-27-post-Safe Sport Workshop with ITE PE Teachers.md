<p>On 22 November 2024, Safe Sport teamed up with Physical Education (PE)
teachers from ITE College Central for a fun and engaging workshop on Safe
Sport principles. The goal? To empower educators with the know-how to create
safe, respectful, and inclusive spaces where students can thrive.</p>

<p>The session was packed with lively discussions on recognising abuse and
harassment, setting professional boundaries, and building a positive sporting
culture. A highlight of the session was hearing teachers share their experiences
supporting students with special needs, sparking meaningful conversations
on inclusivity in safeguarding.</p>
<p>With hands-on activities and plenty of idea-sharing, the workshop wasn't
just informative - it was a great opportunity for peer learning and inspiration.
After the session, the teachers left armed with knowledge, strategies and
a shared commitment to cultivating positive and empowering sporting experiences
for all.</p>
