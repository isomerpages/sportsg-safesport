<p>On 22 November 2024, Safe Sport conducted a workshop for 17 ITE Physical
Education (PE) teachers to raise awareness about Safe Sport principles.
The session focused on equipping educators with the knowledge and tools
to create safe, respectful, and inclusive environments for all students.</p>
<p>Participants explored key topics such as recognising and addressing abuse
and harassment, maintaining professional boundaries, and fostering a positive
sporting culture. Teachers also discussed and shared concerns regarding
supporting students with special needs, emphasising the importance of inclusive
safeguarding practices to address their unique challenges.</p>
<p>Engaging discussions and interactive activities helped deepen participantsâ€™
understanding of Safe Sport values and their practical application in educational
settings. The workshop also provided a platform for peer learning and sharing

efforts ensure that all students feel supported and valued within a secure
and nurturing environment.</p>
