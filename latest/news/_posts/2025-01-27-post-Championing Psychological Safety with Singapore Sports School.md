<p>Did you know that the International Olympic Committee recently revised
the definition of Safe Sport? Safe Sport is now:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A physically and psychologically safe and supportive athletic environment
where participants can thrive and experience the full benefits of sport
participation"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Among the first to act on this expanded definition was Singapore Sports
School (SSP) who invited Safe Sport to conduct workshops on 23<sup>rd</sup> January
2025, with the theme of creating psychologically safe environments. Having
been to SSP in 2021 and 2022 for awareness workshops with the staff and
students, we are grateful to be invited back at this timely juncture.</p>

<p>Often safeguarding is associated with case management and responding to
reports. In practice, a key element of safeguarding is also the everyday
preventative and advocacy work. In line with the updated definition, we
curated sessions where coaches and staff could discuss how SSP provides
a psychologically safe environment for its students now, and what could
be done going forward.</p>

<p>Using Fletcher and Sarkarâ€™s (2019) Challenge and Support model, participants
learnt about the fine balance between challenge and support to achieve
psychologically safe environments. The coaches and administrators were
separated into different sessions, and feedback showed they appreciated
the opportunity to connect with colleagues openly and candidly.</p>
<p>One key highlight was the honest discussions about the challenges they
have in their respective roles, and they shared the support and resources
they need to be able to create a facilitative environment for the students.</p>
