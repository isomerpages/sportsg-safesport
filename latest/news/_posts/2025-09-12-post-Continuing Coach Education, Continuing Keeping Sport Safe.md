<p>“<em>It’s always good to be reminded of the Code of Ethics and Safe Sport principles from time to time. Linking the two together reinforces how closely they go hand in hand in guiding coaches in creating a safe, respectful sporting environment.</em>”
- Anthony Sng</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CoachSG’s Safe Sport and Coaching Industry Development team recently conducted
a "Coaches' Code of Ethics and Safe Sport Workshop" for coaches as part
of their Continuing Coach Education (CCE) programme. A total of 42 coaches,
who are all on the National Registry of Coaches (NROC), were present at
the workshop.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Safe Sport portion of the workshop re-introduced participants to Safe
Sport and the types of abuse seen in coaching. To get the ball rolling,
case studies based on real-life scenarios were given to see what the coaches'
opinions were, whether they thought the situation was a “<em>red flag</em>”,
a “<em>warning</em>” or if “<em>it is okay</em>”. As NROC coaches, the
participants would have already been familiar with Safe Sport through our
e-learning module, and so they were able to identify the issues in the
case studies with ease.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The final part of the workshop saw participants break out into groups
to discuss given scenarios and if there were any forms of misconduct present.
These discussions uncovered many interesting and diverse perspectives;
they also raised a few questions on “grey areas” and how to best approach
them. Through sharing and discourse, participants learnt from one another
and developed a deeper understanding of ethical coaching practices and
safeguarding responsibilities.</p>
<p>It was heartening to hear from passionate coaches who are all committed
to creating a safer and more conducive environment for their athletes.
We thank all participants for sharing their journey with us, and we look
forward to continuously working together to make sport safe for everyone.&nbsp;</p>
