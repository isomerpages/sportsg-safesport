The Safe Sport Commission conducted a workshop for Sport Leaders from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) on 18 July 2023. As Captains or Vice-captains of their respective sport clubs, they hold the important role of influencing the culture in their sporting environments. Through the workshop, the participants learned about the different types of abuse and harassment, and engaged in lively discussions on how they would react to case scenarios of safe sport misconducts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

As the first Institute of Higher Learning (IHL) to increase the awareness of Safe Sport for its sporting community, we are glad to be part of NTU's commitment in promoting a safe, positive and equitable sporting environment.
