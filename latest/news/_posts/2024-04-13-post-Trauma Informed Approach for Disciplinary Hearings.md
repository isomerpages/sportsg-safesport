<p>The Safe Sport’s Disciplinary Panel Members (DP Members) attended a session
on Trauma Informed Approach for Disciplinary Hearings led by Jolie Tan,
a former psychologist from the Clinical and Forensic Psychological Services
Branch of the Ministry of Social and Family Development. Jolie, who has
conducted numerous trainings on topics related to trauma recovery, has
worked with children and youth on behavioural management and self-injury.</p>

<h4>What does it mean to be trauma informed?</h4>
<p>The group was taken on a journey that involved recognising signs of trauma,
learning how to respond sensitively to support trauma recovery and crafting
safe spaces for affected parties, witnesses and respondents during hearings.
With Jolie’s guidance, the DP Members engaged in the following exercises:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>recognising the nuanced signs of trauma</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing active listening skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>asking questions in a trauma-informed manner</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>DP Members also learnt of the 3 basic survival responses to threat; fight,
flight, freeze – which would influence how individuals react when faced
with unpleasant, unwanted or stressful situations. &nbsp;Some common myths
related to freezing instead of showing signs of resistance or trying to
escape during a traumatic incident were discussed and case studies were
analysed.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Additionally, DP Members learnt about the traumatic stress reactions that
encompass a wide range of responses:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>physiological (e.g. being easily fatigued, increased heart rate or breathing
rate)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>emotional (e.g. being emotionally numb or being more emotional than normal)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>psychological (e.g. self-blame, having frequent nightmares)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>behavioural (e.g. finding it hard to function at work or school, engaging
in unhealthy ways of coping)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By understanding these common responses, DP Members &nbsp;were better
able to understand the reactions of those affected in the context of the
cases, particularly in relation to the time it takes an affected party
to report an incident or often, to even come to the realisation that they
are the subject of abuse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The session was transformative and we picked up knowledge on how to better
create a safe and trauma-informed space during hearings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Lively group discussions were sparked with insights and perspectives exchanged.
The message that was driven home was that there is no fixed way for coping
with trauma. The consensus of those in attendance was that they found the
session to be transformative and each had picked up knowledge on how to
better&nbsp; create a safe and trauma-informed space during hearings.</p>
