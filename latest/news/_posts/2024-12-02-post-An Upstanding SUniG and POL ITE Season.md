<p>Before we go any further... Have you taken the <a href="https://play.solstice.sg/safesport/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Upstander Test</a>? Its not
too late to join in the fun and find out what kind of teammate you are!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Over the annual SUniG and POL-ITE games, another competition was afoot.
Our challenge to tertiary athletes: which Institution is the most Upstanding?</p>
<p></p>
<p>While most may know what it means to be a Bystander, there are plenty
of Upstanders in our midst too. An Upstander is someone who refuses to
take inaction, and stands up for what is right. Through speaking out, Upstanders
break the cycle of complicity and thus make sport a safer place.</p>

Test. Out of the 13 Institutes of Higher Learning who participated, 2 emerged
as the most Upstanding of them all...</p>
