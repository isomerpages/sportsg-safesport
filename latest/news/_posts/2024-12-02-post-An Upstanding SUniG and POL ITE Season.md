<p>Before we go any further... Have you taken the <a href="https://play.solstice.sg/safesport/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Upstander Test</a>? Its not
too late to join in the fun and find out what kind of teammate you are!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Over the annual SUniG and POL-ITE games, another competition was afoot.
Our challenge to tertiary athletes: which Institution is the most Upstanding?</p>
<p></p>
<p>While most may know what it means to be a Bystander, we'd like to think
there are plenty of Upstanders in our midst too. An Upstander is someone
who refuses to take inaction, and stands up for what is right. Through
speaking out, Upstanders break the cycle of complicity and thus make sport
a safer place.</p>
