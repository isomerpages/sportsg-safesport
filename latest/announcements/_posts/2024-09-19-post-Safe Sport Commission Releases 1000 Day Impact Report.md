<p>The Safe Sport Programme, a harmonised framework for safeguarding sport
in Singapore, recently marked its 1,000th day. To commemorate this milestone,
the Safe Sport Commission released an impact report to highlight the significant
strides made to foster a positive sporting environment in the areas of
policymaking, training and education and case management - the three central
pillars of the Safe Sport framework.</p>

<p><u>Policymaking</u>
</p>
<p>Launched in November 2021, the Safe Sport Programme sets a comprehensive
standard for safeguarding practices across the sporting community that
has been widely embraced by athletes, parents, coaches, instructors, and
sports administrators.</p>
<p>To date, 60 sporting organisations have signed onto the national framework.
Member organisations have incorporated the Safe Sport Unified Code into
their organisational policies and governance documentations, as well as
put in place mechanisms for reporting and responding to concerns.</p>
<p>As a key signatory to the Safe Sport Programme, Sport Singapore (SportSG)
has taken the lead to protect the well-being of its participants, which
has impacted close to 150,000 persons under its initiatives, including
ActiveSG facility users and Learn-to-Play programme participants, children
and youths participants in the ActiveSG Academies and Clubs, Team Nila
volunteers, Team Singapore athletes supported by the Singapore Sport Institute
(SSI) and coaches registered with the National Registry of Coaches (NROC).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Training and Education</u>
</p>
<p>In the aspect of training and education, the Safe Sport Commission has
been actively engaging the sporting community to nurture a culture of awareness
and accountability across the sport organisations. As of 19 August 2024,
the team has conducted 292 man-hours of workshops and outreach, trained
431 safeguarding officers across 138 organisations, and achieved a completion
of 9,247 training modules.</p>
<p>Through collaborations with the Singapore Institute of Architects and
Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs), the Safe Sport Commission also continues
to explore other aspects of safe sport, for example, how the design of
the physical environment contributes to incidents of abuse and harassment,
as well as understanding bystander behaviours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Case Management</u>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The streamlined case management service has been a crucial part of the
Safe Sport Programme as it allows for independent investigation of reports
of concern, which gives assurance to affected parties and respondents that
reports will be managed fairly. It also relieves member organisations of
the administrative burden of investigating serious cases and ensuring appropriately
trained personnel are involved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the first 1,000 days, the Safe Sport Commission received 274 reports
of concern, of which 126 reports were assessed to be related to misconduct
under the Safe Sport Unified Code. The most number of reported cases were
relating to physical and psychological misconduct, which comprise slightly
over half (56%) of the total cases. Athletes (32%) represented the largest
group of affected parties, while coaches (48%) represented the largest
group of respondents. Majority of the misconduct cases (62%) were classified
as low severity, while 21% and 17% were classified as moderate and severe
cases respectively.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moderate and severe cases were referred to the Safe Sport Disciplinary
Panel, where the Panel will ascertain the seriousness of the misconduct
based on the degree of culpability and harm caused, and consider the aggravating
and mitigating factors before coming to a decision on the appropriate measures
or sections. Since it was first appointed in August 2022, the Safe Sport
Disciplinary Panel, has convened nine hearings to date, and issued sanctions
ranging from suspensions to permanent ineligibility. The outcomes of the
hearings are listed in a disciplinary database.</p>
