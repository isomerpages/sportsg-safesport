<p>The Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) has appointed the
Safe Sport Disciplinary Panel members for its second term. Beginning 1
August 2024, the independent Safe Sport Disciplinary Panel will comprise
eight Legal Members and twelve Ordinary Members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new appointments for the independent Safe Sport Disciplinary Panel’s
three-year term, include the following:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Ms Kuah Boon Theng</strong>, Senior Counsel is appointed
at the Safe Sport Disciplinary Panel Chair. She replaces Ms Molly Lim Kheng
Yen, Senior Counsel, who was instrumental in the setting up the processes,
has elected to step down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Former national athlete <strong>Ms Joscelin Yeo</strong> (swimming)
and <strong>Ms Quek Soo Teng</strong> (volleyball) have been appointed as
Ordinary Members.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New Legal Members appointed include former athlete <strong>Mr Sudhershen Hariram</strong> (football)
and<strong> </strong>current athlete <strong>Mr Koh Jian Ying</strong> (water
polo), as well as, <strong>Mr Eugene Quah</strong> who has served in a similar
capacity on the Singapore Disability Sports Council.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Serving as an independent adjudicative function under the Safe Sport Programme,
the Disciplinary Panel convened more than five hearings during a period
of eleven-months in its first term. The outcome of the decisions made by
the independent Disciplinary Committees are available on the Safe Sport
Commission’s Disciplinary Database which can be accessed <a href="https://www.safesport.sg/case-management/disciplinarydatabase/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Since 2021, the Commission has seen a twenty percent increase year-on-year
in the number of Reports of Concern. A corresponding rise in cases and
hearings is foreseen in the following years and the number of Legal Members
has increased from five to eight to better manage the anticipated caseload
increase.</p>
<p>During its inaugural term, the members were not just actively involved
in hearings but in communities of practice with the Safe Sport Support
Network. The members also participated in training sessions on trauma-informed
approaches in the disciplinary process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most members from the first term have chosen to continue their service,
bringing valuable experience and continuity to the Safe Sport Disciplinary
Panel. &nbsp;</p>
