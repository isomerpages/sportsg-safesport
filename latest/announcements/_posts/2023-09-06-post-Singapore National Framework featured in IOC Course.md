The Safe Sport Commission have been invited by the course directors of the International Olympic Committee's ("IOC") Safeguarding in Officer in Sport certificate course to present a lecture on the development and implementation of Singapore’s national framework for safeguarding in sport, the Safe Sport Programme.

The first of its kind IOC course leading to certification was established in September 2021 to meet the need for a minimum [standard of education or training](https://www.sportsoracle.com/course/ioc-certificate-safeguarding-officer-in-sport/) for safeguarding officers in sport on an international level. The five-month education course is developed by an International Advisory Board of experts, under three Programme Directors.

The half an hour lecture by the Safe Sport Commission has been included in Module 2 on _Putting Safeguards in place; international human rights conventions, statutory and sport legal and policy frameworks_.  In the lecture, the Commission outlines the premise behind the guiding principles of the framework – (H.E.A.R) Harmonization, Empowerment, Accessibility and Respect.

The Commission also explains how the nearly year-long community consultations in 2021 helped shape the design of the national framework including key stakeholder input on:

* definitions of misconduct in the Safe Sport Unified Code
* model of implementation
* nomenclature use in case management
* factors to consider in assessing seriousness of misconduct
* features within the procedures in mitigating barriers to reporting
