<p>Safe Sport visited the bowling lanes of Temasek Club on 17 September 2025
to conduct a Safe Sport Awareness workshop for Singapore Bowling Federation
(SBF) coaches. A total of 44 Centre of Excellence (COE) coaches attended
the workshop.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The aims of the workshop were to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>understand the definition of Safe Sport</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>identify forms of misconduct and harassment, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>discuss the role and responsibilities of coaches to keep bowling safe
for all&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As COE coaches, they often work with young children and minors; it is
therefore imperative that they are able to recognise abuse and harassment,
maintain professional boundaries, and uphold proper conduct.&nbsp;</p>

</div>
<p>Participants were split into small groups to discuss realistic scenarios
to deepen their understanding of creating safe and supportive learning
environments.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Seeing real life examples of misconduct was an eye opener. It showed
us that it can happen anytime and anywhere, even on a digital space"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Through sharing unique experiences and perspectives, an environment of
peer learning and self-reflection is fostered. Interactions like this empower
coaches with the skills and confidence to ensure that all athletes feel
respected and valued within the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We thank the SBF and all participants for their commitment to upholding
the values of Safe Sport.&nbsp;</p>
