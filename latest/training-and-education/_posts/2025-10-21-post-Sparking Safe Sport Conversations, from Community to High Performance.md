<p>In recent months, the Safe Sport team has been busy on the ground - showcasing
a new form of Safe Sport awareness from school to&nbsp; Southeast Asian
(SEA) Games bound athletes.</p>
<p>At&nbsp;<strong>Dunman Secondary School's Wellness &amp; Mental Health Week</strong>,
students learned how emotional well-being and Safe Sport go hand in hand.
At youth events like the&nbsp;<strong>MSIG Serenity Cup</strong>&nbsp;(9–12
years) and&nbsp;<strong>Pesta Sukan Netball Competition</strong>&nbsp;(13–14
years), young athletes engaged with the&nbsp;<strong>Upstander Test</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>gachapon machine</strong>,
learning through fun and reflection about respect and boundaries in sport.</p>

<p>The team also met aspiring athletes at the&nbsp;<strong>Peter Lim Scholarship Awards</strong>,
discussing the importance of safeguarding and being upstanders in their
sporting community for their fellow athletes, as their sporting careers
take off.</p>

<p>At the&nbsp;SNOC Athletes Commission’s "<strong>SEA You at the Games</strong>"
event, Safe Sport reached the elite stage - engaging high performance athletes
headed to the SEA Games later this year, many of whom are set to make their
debut.</p>

<p>From the community to the podium, the message remains the same. <strong>Safe Sport is everyone’s responsibility, and every athlete can be an Upstander.</strong>
