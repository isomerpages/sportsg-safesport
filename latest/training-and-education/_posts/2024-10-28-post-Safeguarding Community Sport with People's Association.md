<p>On 21<sup>st</sup> October 2024, Safe Sport was engaged by People's Association
(PA) to conduct an Awareness Workshop for PAâ€™s trainers. A total of 29
trainers participated in the session, gaining critical insights into recognising
abuse and harassment, maintaining professional boundaries, and upholding
proper conduct.</p>

<p>Participants explored realistic scenarios to deepen their understanding
of creating safe and supportive learning environments. These discussions
empowered them with the skills and confidence to ensure that all students
feel respected and valued within the community.</p>

<p>"The session helped me reflect on my coaching methods, and being mindful
of how I communicate with students, both face-to-face and digitally"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The workshop also provided a valuable platform for trainers to share best
practices and foster peer learning. Through this collaborative effort,
we are proud to support trainers in becoming champions of Safe Sport values,
ensuring a positive and inclusive experience for all learners.</p>
