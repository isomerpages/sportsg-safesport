<p>As part of our continued commitment to safeguarding, a refresher Safe
Sport workshop was conducted for School Football Academy (SFA) coaches
from the Unleash the Roar (UTR) programme.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The session brought together coaches who had previously attended an earlier
version of our Safe Sport workshop back in 2022, as well as coaches who
were attending for the first time. It offered a unique opportunity for
the coaches to collaborate, revisit key principles, and strengthen best
practices in an ever-changing sporting landscape.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The workshop reinforced coaches’ roles in creating safe, respectful and
inclusive spaces for young athletes, while also addressing updated safeguarding
considerations and scenarios relevant to football as a Co-Curricular Activity
(CCA) in Singaporean schools.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Refresher workshops like this forms part of our ongoing efforts to ensure
safeguarding remains an active and evolving practice, not just a one-off
requirement, within the UTR programme as well as the wider football scene
in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
