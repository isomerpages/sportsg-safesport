<p>The Safe Sport team had the honour of being invited to the 2026 National
School Games (NSG) opening ceremony – one of Singapore’s largest inter-school
sporting events with more than 800 student-athletes, teachers and coaches
in attendance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We hosted a booth with the aim of raising Safe Sport awareness by engaging
athletes, as well as their teachers, through the Upstander test and other
educational resources. The Upstander test encouraged participants to reflect
on how they can speak up, look out for one another, and contribute to a
safer sporting environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Close to 100 guests completed the Upstander test over the course of the
event, including Minister for Education, Mr Desmond Lee, with many of them
remarking that the activity was informative and fresh. Upon completion
of the test, participants were given exclusive Safe Sport keychains and
stickers, adding a fun and memorable touch to the learning experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The strong interest and positive engagement made the activation truly
meaningful, and we are heartened to be able to empower young athletes to
be upstanders both on and off the court. We would like to thank the Ministry
of Education for having us at this prestigious ceremony and we wish all
athletes the very best in their competitions.&nbsp;</p>
