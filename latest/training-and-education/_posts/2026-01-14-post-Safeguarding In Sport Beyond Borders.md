<p>The Commission recently conducted its first Safeguarding Officer training
of 2026, facilitated by <em>the irrepressible</em> Jolie Tan. This run welcomed
a diverse cohort of safeguarding practitioners, including delegates from
Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines, adding valuable regional
perspectives to the learning experience.</p>

<p>Designed as a comprehensive and practice-focused programme, the course
places strong emphasis on real case discussions and realistic role-play
scenarios, preparing participants for scenarios they may encounter in their
roles. Many participants shared that they have benefited from the exercises,
and that the course has influenced how they approach safeguarding responsibilities.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The training clearly emphasises athlete safety, building awareness of
boundaries and consent, and gives practical guidance on how to recognise
and report concerns with confidence"</p>

year ahead of a curriculum review. Interested participants may register
