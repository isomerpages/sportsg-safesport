<p>14 Safeguarding Officers (SO) joined us at our Safe Sport Community of
Practice (CoP) held on 2<sup>nd</sup> October 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal of the session was to provide SOs the chance to continuously
utilise and sharpen their information gathering abilities when attending
to Affected Persons (APs). It was led by Jolie, an experienced trainer
and psychologist, who has also been delivering our Safeguarding Officer
Training course since 2022.</p>

<p>Jolie opened the session by addressing tricky questions based on scenarios
that the SOs have experienced, sharing suggestions and tips on how to approach
challenging situations.</p>

<p>Participants were split into pairs and were given two different role-play
practices. They took turns playing the role of an SO and an AP who had
either experienced or witnessed forms of abuse. Each pair was facilitated
by a Safe Sport secretariat member.</p>

<p>After each scenario, positive interactions were acknowledged, and recommended
practices were reiterated in a debrief. One example of this is how the
SOs should try their best to use open-ended questions when speaking with
an AP, so they can elaborate on their thoughts and feelings.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Role playing prepared me for future situations and being able to help
when the need arises. It was a great format made better by the engaging
trainer, Jolie”&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The role of a Safeguarding Officer is challenging, but participants understand
the importance of the work they do. Their dedication serves as an encouraging
reminder of perseverance in safeguarding efforts.</p>

<p>The Safe Sport team remains dedicated to supporting SOs and creating more
opportunities for further learning and growth. A massive thank you to Jolie
and all SOs who joined us and for their contributions to a truly meaningful
evening.&nbsp;</p>
