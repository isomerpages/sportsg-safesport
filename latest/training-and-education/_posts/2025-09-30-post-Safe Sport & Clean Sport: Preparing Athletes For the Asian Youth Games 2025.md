<p>As part of preparations for the upcoming Asian Youth Games&nbsp;(AYG)&nbsp;2025
in Bahrain,&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;workshop&nbsp;on Safe Sport&nbsp;was&nbsp;held
for&nbsp;Team Singapore&nbsp;athletes and&nbsp;coaches. The briefing was
done in&nbsp;tandem&nbsp;with Anti-Doping Singapore&nbsp;(ADS)&nbsp;and
the Travel Advisory team&nbsp;to ensure that our young athletes are&nbsp;informed&nbsp;and
ready&nbsp;to&nbsp;represent&nbsp;the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Participants were asked to do&nbsp;our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.safesport.sg/upstander-test/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Upstander Test</a>&nbsp;to
see&nbsp;if&nbsp;they&nbsp;would stand up for what is right,&nbsp;or if
they were a bystander. They enjoyed&nbsp;comparing their test results with
their&nbsp;peers, even discussing what selections they made and why. The
Upstander Test serves as a useful tool&nbsp;to&nbsp;remind&nbsp;all&nbsp;sport&nbsp;participants&nbsp;that&nbsp;they&nbsp;have
a responsibility to keep sport&nbsp;safe for everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The athletes were introduced to the different&nbsp;forms of misconduct
and harassment, as well as&nbsp;how best to safeguard themselves&nbsp;at
the Games.&nbsp;Resources available to them at the&nbsp;Games were also
shared, including reporting channels&nbsp;in both&nbsp;Bahrain and&nbsp;Singapore
as concerns that are criminal in nature must be reported in-country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To end&nbsp;off, they were reminded of the&nbsp;<strong>3Rs:&nbsp;Recognise, Respond, Refer</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Recognise:&nbsp;Be&nbsp;observant&nbsp;and&nbsp;note&nbsp;any changes
in&nbsp;behaviour&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Respond:&nbsp;Withold judgement and&nbsp;listen&nbsp;to&nbsp;all&nbsp;concerns
raised&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>

the reporting channels.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Safe Sport wishes the AYG 2025&nbsp;Team Singapore athletes and coaches&nbsp;all
