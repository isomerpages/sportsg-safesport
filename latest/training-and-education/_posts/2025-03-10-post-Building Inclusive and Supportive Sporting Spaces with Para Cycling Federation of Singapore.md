<p><em>"Thought-provoking and informative session!"</em>
<br>
</p>
<p><em>"Case studies and real-world scenarios helped us spot red flags in a sporting environment."</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These were just some of the powerful takeaways from the recent Safe Sport
Workshop with the <strong>Para Cycling Federation of Singapore’s</strong> dedicated
coaches, volunteers, and caregivers.</p>

<p>The session was a deep dive into the importance of safeguarding in sport,
using real-life case studies to spark discussion and reflection. The passionate
group brought heart and curiosity, sharing lived experiences that made
for engaging and meaningful conversation.</p>
<p>Key discussions centred around the impact of language and tone when communicating
with athletes—exploring where the line is drawn between effective coaching
and potential verbal harm. Recognising red flags in behaviour, understanding
the nuances of power dynamics, and fostering a psychologically safe environment
were all critical aspects of the dialogue.</p>
<p>A special shoutout to Mr. Quintus Ong, Owner and Coach of The Little Swimmer,
whose 15+ years of experience working with persons with disabilities brought
invaluable depth and expertise to the session. He shared best practices
for engaging and managing special needs athletes, offering practical strategies
to enhance both their safety and sporting experience.</p>

<p>A huge thank you to everyone who contributed their voices and perspectives!
It is through these collaborative efforts that we continue to strengthen
the culture of Safe Sport and create inclusive, supportive, and protective
environments for all athletes.</p>
