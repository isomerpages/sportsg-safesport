<p>If you haven't already, give the Safe Sport Unified Code a read! It came
about after months of consultations with many groups of sport stakeholders
in Singapore.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Did you know?</h4>
<p>The Safe Sport Unified Code is a free to use document!</p>
<p>Think of the Unified Code as a book of definitions, which states the forms
of harassment and abuse that are unacceptable in sport. By making reference
to the Unified Code, your club/tournament adopts the same definitions.</p>
<p>You can also use the Unified Code as a starting point for your own book
of definitions.</p>
<p>In the event of a Safe Sport incident, simply check back with what the
Unified Code defines as abuse and harassment then proceed with your standard
process. If you are a member organisation of the Safe Sport Programme,
inform us immediately.</p>
