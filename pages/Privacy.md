<h3><strong>Government Agency Privacy Statement</strong></h3>
<p><strong><u>"General"</u></strong>
</p>
<p>1. This is a Government Agency website.</p>
<p>2. We may use “cookies”, where a small data file is sent to your browser
to store and track information about you when you enter our digital service.
The cookie is used to track information such as the number of users and
their frequency of use, profiles of users and their preferred digital services.
While this cookie can tell us when you enter our digital services and which
pages you visit, it cannot read data off your hard disk.</p>
<p>3. You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically
accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline
cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage
of the digital service.</p>
<p><strong><u>Use of Data</u></strong>
</p>
<p>4. If you provide us with personal data:</p>
<p>a. Where appropriate, we may share necessary data with other Government
Agencies, so as to improve the discharge of public functions, and to serve
you in the most efficient and effective way unless such sharing is prohibited
by law. This includes data shared for the purposes of the planning and
delivery of other services, programmes, events, offerings or products by
any Government Agency, which may entail the partner Agency contacting or
sending you marketing material in relation to offerings which may be of
interest to you.</p>
<p>b. We may share your personal data with non-Government entities that have
been authorised to carry out specific Government services. We will NOT
share your personal data with other non-Government entities without your
consent except where such sharing complies with the law.</p>
<p>c. For your convenience, we may also display to you data that you had
previously supplied us or other Government Agencies. This will speed up
the transaction and save you the trouble of repeating previous submissions.
Should the data be out-of-date, please supply us the latest data.</p>
<p>d. You have granted us and other Government Agencies the consent to contact
you or communicate with you on marketing communications, and/or eNewsletters
on programmes, events and news to improve on our planning and delivery
of our and/or other services and products provided by Government Agencies.</p>
<p>e. You have the right at any time to unsubscribe or opt out of receiving
marketing communications or eNewsletters by following the instructions
provided in the emails or contacting us at the contact address stated in
this Privacy Statement.</p>
<p>f.&nbsp;You may withdraw your consent to the use and disclosure of your
data by us with reasonable notice and subject to any prevailing legal or
contractual restrictions; however, doing so may prevent the proper functioning
of the Service and may also result in the cessation of the Service to you.
Withdrawing consent to receive marketing communications or eNewsletters
will not prevent you from using the Service but will stop you receiving
promotional messages from us.</p>
<p><strong><u>Protection of Data</u></strong>
</p>
<p>5. To safeguard your personal data, all electronic storage and transmission
of personal data is secured with appropriate security technologies.</p>
<p>6. This digital service may contain links to non-Government digital services
