<h5>Beginnings</h5>
<p>The Safe Sport Taskforce was formed under CoachSG, a division under the
Singapore Sport Institute, in 2018 to look into promoting of values and
best practices of Safe Sport, safeguarding athletes, participants and officials
and protecting the integrity of sport and sports organisations.</p>
<h5>Safe Sport Commission established</h5>
<p>Sport Singapore established the Safe Sport Commission in 2019 as advisory
panel to drive effective implementation of Safe Sport initiatives and policies.
Under its guidance, the Safe Sport Taskforce began to lay the foundations
for the Safe Sport Programme such as</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>creating a curriculum and training safeguarding officers within the National
Sports Associations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing the Safe Sport awareness education modules and advocacy materials</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establishing a reporting protocol for major games</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>A New Chapter</h5>
<p>In 2021, the Safe Sport Commission pivoted from its advisory role to one
that maintains a secretariat to perform the necessary functions to administer
the Safe Sport Programme.</p>
<p>Today, the Safe Sport Commission's secretariat performs 3 key functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Policy &amp; Advocacy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Training &amp; Education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Case Management</p>
</li>
</ul>
