### Why is Safe Sport important?

Inappropriate behaviour in the community affects enjoyment and participation in sport at all levels. If left
unaddressed by the sporting fraternity and our governing institutions, it will:

1.  **Compromise the safety and well-being** of affected persons which can have lifelong impact or life threatening situations

2. **Allow fractures to develop** within the community when disputes are not managed well, or at all, by the
organisation(s) responsible

3. **Create a culture of permissibility** and the manifestation of negative habits and norms within sport, which may culminate into disciplinary issues or crimes overtime

4. **Leading to departure** from the sport due to the concerned parties' disillusionment in the system to protect them
