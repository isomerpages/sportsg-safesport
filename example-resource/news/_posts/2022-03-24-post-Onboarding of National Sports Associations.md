The Safe Sport Commission has commenced the rollout of the Safe Sport Programme to National Sports Associations ("NSAs").

NSAs will be progressively onboarded to the Safe Sport Programme throughout the course of the year.

The first step in the onboarding process involves the adoption of the Safe Sport Unified Code and the mechanism for reporting and resolution in the Safe Sport Programme Handbook.

All the information required for onboarding of the NSAs is provided on the  [onboarding site](https://www.safesport.sg/onboarding).
