<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>1. Does every case lead to a hearing before a Disciplinary Committee?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>No. It depends on the seriousness of the alleged breach of the <a href="https://www.safesport.sg/safe-sport-programme/unified-code" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Safe Sport Unified Code</a> (“Unified
Code”).</p>
<p></p>
<p>The level of seriousness of a breach can be classified as low, medium
or high based on the Assessment of Seriousness.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A breach that is classified at a low level of seriousness will be managed
by the Member Organisation. Breaches of higher levels of seriousness will
be managed by the Commission.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To learn more about the Assessment of Seriousness, see Appendix 1 &amp;
2 of the <a href="https://www.safesport.sg/case-management/service/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Safe Sport Programme Handbook</a> (“
the Handbook”).</p>

<summary><strong>2. Why is there a need for a hearing?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p></p>
<p>The purpose of a hearing is twofold:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>to allow the Respondent an opportunity to provide their account to an
independent Disciplinary Committee</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to determine the appropriate sanctions where the Disciplinary Committee
decides that a breach of the Unified Code has occurred</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>3. Who will be on the Disciplinary Committee?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p></p>
<p>The Discipline Panel Chairperson will normally appoint three (3) Members
from the Disciplinary Panel to form the Disciplinary Committee for the
hearing which will be made up of:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>one (1) Legal Member, who will chair the hearing</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>two (2) Ordinary Members</p>
<p></p>

<p>The Members of the Disciplinary Panel have been appointed by the Ministry
of Culture, Community and Youth.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The criteria for becoming a Disciplinary Panel Member can be found in
Appendix 5 of the Handbook.</p>
<p></p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>6. May I admit to the breach(es) before the hearing?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p></p>
<p>Yes, you may admit to the alleged breach(es) at any time before the hearing
or even during the hearing. If you do so, the Disciplinary Committee will
proceed to determine if any sanction(s) should be imposed and in the process,
mitigating or aggravating factor(s) will be considered.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For more information, please see Section 8.6 and Appendix 3 of the Handbook.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>7. Will I be subjected to any temporary measures before the hearing?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p></p>
<p>Temporary measures may be imposed pending investigations based on:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>severity of the Misconduct</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sufficiency of evidence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>risk of further harm</p>

<summary><strong>1. What if I am unable to attend the hearing?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p></p>
<p>If you are unable to attend due to illness or unforeseen circumstances,
do write to the secretariat (<a href="mailto:report@safesport.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">report@safesport.sg</a>) specifying your
reasons. The Disciplinary Committee will decide whether to adjourn the

</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p></p>
<p>You would have received a Notice of Hearing which comprises the details
of the documents and the procedures involved in the hearing process.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Where the case is complex, the Disciplinary Committee Chair may decide
that a pre-hearing meeting with you may be necessary to assist the Disciplinary
Committee managing the hearing process.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can find out more of the hearing procedures in Section 18 of the Handbook.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>3. How does the Disciplinary Committee make a decision?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p></p>
<p>Based on the available evidence and the balance of probabilities, the
Disciplinary Committee will determine if a breach has taken place.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The decision-making framework, based on culpability and harm, guides the
Disciplinary Committee in making an appropriate decision on the measures
and/or sanctions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can find out more about this in Section 8.4 and Appendix 2 of the
Handbook.</p>

</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p></p>
<p>Unlike court processes which are adversarial, the objective of these proceedings
is inquisitorial in nature. Therefore, there is no direct questioning of
the Affected Party and/or other witnesses except by the Disciplinary Committee.</p>
