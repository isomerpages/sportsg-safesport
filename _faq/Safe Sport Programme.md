<h5><strong>1. Who was consulted in the development of the Unified Code and the Safe Sport Programme?</strong></h5>
<p>The development of the Unified Code and the Safe Sport Programme was guided
by the following international frameworks on safeguarding in sport.</p>
<p>The International Olympic Committe's Prevention of Harrassment and Abuse
Initiatives (<a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/safe-sport" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">PHAS</a>)
includes the <em><a href="https://stillmed.olympic.org/media/Document%20Library/OlympicOrg/IOC/What-We-Do/Protecting-Clean-Athletes/Safeguarding/IOC-Consensus-Statement_Harassment-and-abuse-in-sport-2016.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2016</a> Consensus Statement: harassment and abuse (non-accidental violence) in sport</em>,
which provides evidence and research regarding these harmful behaviours
and their impacts.</p>
<p>Jurisdictions like the <a href="https://uscenterforsafesport.org/response-and-resolution/safesport-code/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">US</a>,
<a href="https://sirc.ca/safesport/policies-practices/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Canada</a>and <a href="https://www.sportintegrity.gov.au/what-we-do/national-integrity-framework" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Australia</a> have
developed frameworks appropriate to their sporting landscapes.</p>
<p>The Safe Sport Unified Code and the Safe Sport Programme is based on these
universal concepts and international evidence but also contextualised for
Singapore's sporting landscape and the sporting community through <a href="/safe-sport-programme/community-consultations" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">extensive consultations</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<h5><strong>2. If I am not a National Sports Association, can I adopt the Unified Code?</strong></h5>
<p>Any sports organisation may adopt the Unified Code by referencing to it
in their organisational safeguarding policies.</p>
<p>Harmonisation and Accessibility are the two guiding principles of the
Safe Sport Programme and providing a single framework for all levels of
sport and different types of sporting organisations is one of the key objectives.
<br>
</p>
<p>For example, commercial sports organisations that wish to have access
to the policy repository, training and education resources and train a
safeguarding officer may become Affiliate Members of the Safe Sport Programme.

assess any potential safeguarding needs.</p>
<p></p>
<h5><strong>3. What are the benefits to becoming a Member Organisation of the Safe Sport Programme?</strong></h5>
<p>The Safe Sport Programme provides a streamlined and harmonised approach
to mitigate threats to Safe Sport and is designed to ease the administrative
burden on sporting organisations. It also reduces the risk of accusations
of bias and conflicts of interests often associated with non-independent
investigations and disciplinary processes.</p>
<p>The Safe Sport Programme supports Member Organisations in two main areas:
<br>
<br>(1) creating a safe sporting environment underpinned by the Unified Code
<br>
<br>(2) addressing reports of concern.
<br>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.safesport.sg/safe-sport-programme/memberorganisations/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Member Organisations</a> receive
support through training of the organisationâ€™s safeguarding officers, access
to <a href="https://www.safesport.sg/policy-and-research/resources/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">model policies</a> (e.g.
child safeguarding, travel, recruitment, digital communications), training
and education resources for participants in their sport to help them understand
their roles and responsibilities.</p>
<p>When a sporting organisation becomes a Member Organisation of the Safe
Sport Programme, the Safe Sport Commission also manages the independent
assessment and referral of complaints/reports which fall under its mandatory
jurisdiction.</p>
<p></p>
<h5><strong>4. What does a Member Organisation need to do to fully implement the Safe Sport Programme?</strong></h5>
<p>To fully implement the Safe Sport Programme, a Member Organisation will
have to:
<br>
<br>(1) adopt the Unified Code and the rules of the Safe Sport Programme on
case management and resolution by putting in place a Safe Sport Policy
which applies to the relevant persons (i.e. employees, contractors, athletes
or participants under its governance and jurisdiction)
<br>
<br>(2) appoint a trained Safeguarding Officer
<br>
<br>(3) enforce the terms of the Safe Sport Policy across its membership,
programmes and/or sanctioned events
<br>
<br>The Safe Sport Commission will undertake an onboarding process with each
Member Organisation to ensure that the Safe Sport Policy is tailored to
its needs.</p>
