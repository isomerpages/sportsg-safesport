##### **1. What kind of reports will the Safe Sport Commission Manage?**

The Case Management Unit of the Safe Sport Commission will only manage reports of concern that relate to
 Misconduct set out in the Unified Code which come under its mandatory jurisdiction (i.e. moderate to severe
 incidents).
 
 Incidents which are classified jointly by the Case Management Unit and the Member Organisation’s Safeguarding Officer as less than moderate, will be managed by the NSA. The Safe Sport Commission may exercise discretionary jurisdiction in certain circumstances (e.g. requested by the Member Organisation and/or person
 affected due to a conflict of interest for an NSA)
 
 The Safe Sport Commission will not manage sport-specific and other general policies related to interpersonal conduct (e.g. field-of-play incidents which are governed by the rules of the sport, breach of curfew set out in a travel policy, unprofessional behaviour which breaches an organisation’s code of conduct which is not related
 to abuse or harassment under the Unified Code).

##### **2.  What support is provided to a person who has experienced Misconduct (“Affected Party”)?**

An Affected Party may opt to make a disclosure or lodge a formal report against another person regarding Misconduct. A disclosure does not trigger a formal process and the Affected Party may be directed to the
 necessary psychosocial support services.
 
The Case Management Unit which is staffed by persons who are experienced in providing psychosocial support
will refer the Affected Party, where appropriate, to befrienders and/or counsellors under its Support Network.
