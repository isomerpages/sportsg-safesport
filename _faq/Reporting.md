##### **1. What kind of reports will the Safe Sport Commission manage?**

The Case Management Service is available to a Member Organisations of the Safe Sport Programme. 

The Safe Sport Commission will not manage sport-specific and other general policies related to interpersonal conduct (e.g. field-of-play incidents which are governed by the rules of the sport, breach of curfew set out in a travel policy, unprofessional behaviour which breaches an organisation’s code of conduct which is not related
 to abuse or harassment under the Unified Code).

##### **2.  What support is provided to a person who has experienced Misconduct (“Affected Party”)?**

An Affected Party may opt to make a disclosure or lodge a formal report against another person regarding Misconduct. A disclosure does not trigger a formal process and the Affected Party may be directed to the necessary psychosocial support services.
 
The Case Management Unit which is staffed by persons who are experienced in providing psychosocial support
will refer the Affected Party, where appropriate, to befrienders and/or counsellors under its Support Network.


##### **3. What constitutes as Safe Sport Misconduct?**

Please refer to the [Safe Sport Unified Code](/safe-sport-programme/unified-code) for types of Misconduct.

##### **4. How do raise an incident I am concerned about?**

You can make a report of concern either through the Safeguarding Officer of your organisation or directly to the Case Management Unit by completing the [incident report form](/case-management/reporting).

##### **5. Can I make a report on someone else's behalf?**

Yes, you may. Do note that Safe Sport will contact the Affected Person to inform of its decision to proceed with the investigation if there is a risk of imminent harm to any person.

##### **6. Can I choose to remain anonymous?**

Yes, you may. However, providing your information will be vastly helpful to a swift and
effective investigation.
