##### **1. What kind of reports will the Safe Sport Commission Manage?**

The Case Management Unit of the Safe Sport Commission will only manage reports of concern that relate to
 Misconduct set out in the Unified Code which come under its mandatory jurisdiction (i.e. moderate to severe
 incidents).
 
 Incidents which are classified jointly by the Case Management Unit and the Member Organisation’s Safeguarding Officer as less than moderate, will be managed by the NSA. The Safe Sport Commission may exercise discretionary jurisdiction in certain circumstances (e.g. requested by the Member Organisation and/or person
 affected due to a conflict of interest for an NSA)
 
 The Safe Sport Commission will not manage sport-specific and other general policies related to interpersonal conduct (e.g. field-of-play incidents which are governed by the rules of the sport, breach of curfew set out in a travel policy, unprofessional behaviour which breaches an organisation’s code of conduct which is not related
 to abuse or harassment under the Unified Code).

##### **2.  What support is provided to a person who has experienced Misconduct (“Affected Party”)?**

An Affected Party may opt to make a disclosure or lodge a formal report against another person regarding Misconduct. A disclosure does not trigger a formal process and the Affected Party may be directed to the
 necessary psychosocial support services.
 
The Case Management Unit which is staffed by persons who are experienced in providing psychosocial support
will refer the Affected Party, where appropriate, to befrienders and/or counsellors under its Support Network.


##### **3. What constitutes as Safe Sport Misconduct?**

Please refer to the [Safe Sport Unified Code](/safe-sport-programme/unified-code) for types of Misconduct.

##### **4. How do I make a Safe Sport report?**

You can report Safe Sport incidents either through the Safeguarding Officer of the member organisation or complete the incident report form [here](/case-management/reporting).

##### **5. Can I make a report on someone else's behalf?**

Yes, you may. Do note that Safe Sport will contact the Affected Person to inform of its decision to proceed with the investigation if there is a risk of imminent harm to any person.

##### **6. Can I choose to remain anonymous?**

Yes, you may. However, providing your information will be vastly helpful to a swift and
effective investigation.

##### **7. What is the difference between ‘Disclosure” and ‘Formal Reporting’?**

A **Disclosure** is simply sharing an experience of being subjected to incident of Misconduct. It
does not launch any formal process such as investigation, disciplinary hearing. Safe Sport
Taskforce will work with the Affected Person and the Respondent to come with a binding
resolution.

In a **Formal Reporting**, Safe Sport Taskforce will investigate if the Misconduct is substantiated.
The Case Management Unit has the discretion to decide if the matter needs to be heard by the
Disciplinary Committee.

##### **8. How long will the investigation take to complete?**

The duration taken to complete the investigation depends on the severity of the Misconduct.
In certain circumstances, the investigation may be postponed until the law enforcement agency
has completed their investigations. Temporary Sanction measures will be imposed in such cases.
