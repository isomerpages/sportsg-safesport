##### **1. How can I access the Awareness Modules?** 

Instructions to create an account are on the [Awareness Module page](https://www.safesport.sg/training-and-education/awareness-module/).

##### **2. If I have completed the Awareness Module, am I Safe Sport trained?**
Yes. You are required to achieve a minimum passing grade of 80% in the assessment to be issued a certificate (auto generated in the e-learning platform) and deemed as Safe Sport trained. 

Remember to download a copy of your certificate for future use.

##### **3. How different is the Awareness module in SpotSG-ED from the workshop?** 
The awareness module in SportSG-ED covers in-depth content on Safe Sport including an assessment component that you are required to pass to attain the certificate and deem as Safe Sport trained. The workshop covers only a portion of the content from the Awareness module in SportSG-ED and no assessment or certificate will be issued upon completion.  
 
##### **5. I would like to conduct a Safe Sport workshop for the community within my sport. Where can I gain access to resources or a trainer to conduct this workshop?**
You may reach out to us at [safe_sport@sport.gov.sg](mailto:safe_sport@sport.gov.sg) and we can discuss and customise the content to suit your target audience.
 

##### **6. I am interested to attend the Safeguarding Officer training. When is the next run of this training?** 
The next run of the Safeguarding Officer will be in a hybrid format. You will be required to complete the online training in SportSG-ED (which will be available from April 2022 onwards) and subsequently attend the classroom training where you will be assessed on your competency.

You can view training dates and sign up [here](https://form.gov.sg/5fd0341bfc3f3100111264b5).
