<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p></p>
<p>The Safeguarding Officer training is in blended learning format. There
are 3 components:</p>
<p></p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>online self-directed learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>classroom (part 1) virtual engagement by facilitator (1/2 day)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>classroom (part 2) in-person (1 day)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>You will be required to complete the e-learning component and subsequently
attend the classroom training where you will be assessed on your competency.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can view training dates and sign up <a href="https://www.safesport.sg/case-management/safeguarding-officer/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[here]</a>.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>I have completed an Awareness Module. Do I still have to do the e-learning for the Safeguarding Officer training?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p></p>
<p>Yes. The Safeguarding Officer training is a certification course that
goes beyond the Awareness Modules, where you will learn about responding
to disclosures of abuse, reporting processes, psychological first aid and
more. The Awareness Modules will provide a good foundation before moving
to the Safeguarding Officer training.</p>
