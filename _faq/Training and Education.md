<summary><strong>What do I need to get a Certificate of Completion for the Awareness Module?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p></p>
<p>Yes! You are required to achieve a minimum passing grade of 80% in the
assessment to be issued a certificate (auto generated in the e-learning
platform).</p>

<summary><strong>How different are the Awareness Modules from a Safe Sport workshop?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p></p>
<p>The awareness modules cover in-depth content on Safe Sport including an
assessment component that you are required to pass to attain the certificate.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our workshops are bespoke to your organisational needs. We recommend that
all workshop participants complete the relevant Awareness Module beforehand
to get the most out of our workshops.</p>

<p>You may reach out to us at <a href="mailto:contact@safesport.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">contact@safesport.sg</a> and we can discuss
and customise the content to suit your target audience.</p>
<h5><strong>5. I am interested to attend the Safeguarding Officer training. When is the next run of this training?</strong></h5>
<p>The next run of the Safeguarding Officer will be in a hybrid format. You
will be required to complete the e-learning component and subsequently
attend the classroom training where you will be assessed on your competency.</p>
<p>You can view training dates and sign up <a href="https://www.safesport.sg/case-management/safeguarding-officer/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[here]</a>.</p>
<h5><strong>6. I have completed an Awareness Module. Do I still have to do the e-learning for the Safeguarding Officer training?</strong></h5>
<p>Yes. The Safeguarding Officer training is a certification course that
goes beyond the Awareness Modules, where you will learn about responding
to disclosures of abuse, reporting processes, psychological first aid and
more. The Awareness Modules will provide a good foundation before moving
to the Safeguarding Officer training.</p>
