#####  Safe Sport Commission established

Sport Singapore established the Safe Sport Commission in 2019 as advisory panel to drive effective implementation of Safe Sport initiatives and policies.  Under its guidance, the Safe Sport Taskforce began to lay the foundations for the Safe Sport Programme such as
