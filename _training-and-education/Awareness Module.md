#### Raising awareness of the importance of safeguarding in sport

Our awareness modules are developed for the different roles that exist within sport. 

Adults such as coaches, parents and sport administrators have a different responsibilities and duty of care to prevent any likelihood of harm occurring in sport. 

For athletes, knowing that they may set their personal boundaries and understanding their own responsbilities towards fellow participants helps to foster a positive environment where inappropriate behaviours are recognized and flagged early.  


#### SportSG-ED
