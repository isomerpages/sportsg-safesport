# Raising awareness of the importance in safeguarding sport
Safeguarding in sport is important as it helps to ensure that everyone participating in sport have a positive experience. Sport contributes to the overall well-being of children and vulnerable adults and it is a platform for them to grow and develop holistically as person. Adults such as coaches, parents and sport administrators have a responsibility and duty of care to prevent any likelihood of harm occurring in sport. Hence, the awareness module is developed for different stakeholders in the sporting community to understand their role in safeguarding sport.
