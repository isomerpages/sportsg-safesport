The Safeguarding Officer Training is for appointed officers from sporting organisations in Singapore. 

It equips officers with the relevant skills to respond and manage disclosures of abuse. They will also learn about Safe Sport, policies and laws covering aspects of Safe Sport and their roles and responsibilities as a Safeguarding
Officer including understanding the reporting procedures.  

The training covers the following:
* Impact of Abuse
* Understanding Offending Behaviour
* Barriers to Reporting
* Responding to Disclosure
* Reporting Procedures
* Laws on Harassment and Abuse

Safeguarding Officers are required to complete the online Safeguarding Officer module in SportSG-ED (available from April 2022 onwards) as a pre-requisite to the classroom training where officers will be assessed on their skills. 

This training is chargeable for non-member organisations of the Safe Sport Programme.
