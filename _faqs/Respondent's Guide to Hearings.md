<summary><strong>1. Does every case lead to a hearing before the independent Disciplinary Committee?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>No. It depends on the seriousness of the alleged breach of the <a href="https://www.safesport.sg/safe-sport-programme/unified-code" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Safe Sport Unified Code</a> (“Unified
Code”).</p>
<p></p>
<p>The level of seriousness of a breach can be classified as low, medium
or high based on the Assessment of Seriousness.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A breach that is classified at a low level of seriousness will be managed
by the Member Organisation. Breaches of higher levels of seriousness will
be managed by the Commission.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To learn more about the Assessment of Seriousness, see Appendix 1 &amp;
2 of the <a href="https://www.safesport.sg/case-management/service/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Safe Sport Programme Handbook</a> (“

<summary><strong>2. Why is there a need for a hearing?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p></p>
<p>The purpose of a hearing is twofold:</p>
<p></p>

<p>to allow the Respondent an opportunity to provide their account to an

</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to determine the appropriate sanctions where the independent Disciplinary
Committee decides that a breach of the Unified Code has occurred</p>
</li>
</ul>

</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>3. Who will be on the independent Disciplinary Committee?</strong>
</summary>

</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p></p>
<p>Yes, you may admit to the alleged breach(es) at any time before the hearing
or even during the hearing. If you do so, the independent Disciplinary
Committee will proceed to determine if any sanction(s) should be imposed
and in the process, mitigating or aggravating factor(s) will be considered.</p>

<p>Based on the available evidence and the balance of probabilities, the

<p>The decision-making framework, based on culpability and harm, guides the
independent Disciplinary Committee in making an appropriate decision on
the measures and/or sanctions.</p>

Handbook.</p>

the Affected Party and/or other witnesses except by the independent Disciplinary
Committee.</p>
