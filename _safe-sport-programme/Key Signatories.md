#### Common Core Values
The three key signatories to the Unified Code are:
* [Singapore National Olympic Council ](https://www.singaporeolympics.com/)
* [Singapore National Paralympic Council](https://www.snpc.org.sg/)
* [Sport Singapore](https://sportsingapore.gov.sg/)


As organisations of note in sport, these leading organisations recognise that only when sporting
environments are safe, can their common values be realised.

By adopting the Safe Sport Unified Code, each of the key signatories underlies their commitment to the principle that all participants in sport should expect to play, practise, compete, officiate, work, volunteer and interact in an
environment that is free from harassment and abuse.
