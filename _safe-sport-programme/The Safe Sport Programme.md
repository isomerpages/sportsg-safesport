### The Safe Sport Unified Code 

The Unified Code is the cornerstone of the Safe Sport Programme and sets out a unified reference for the Singapore sporting community that describes the forms of abuse and harassment which may take place in the sporting environment (“Misconduct”).
The Unified Code may be adopted by any organisation by reference to the Unified Code in its member protection policies.

### The Safe Sport Programme (SSP)
 
The Safe Sport Programme comprises all the elements required to optimize harmonisation and best practice for sporting organisations that are members of the Safe Sport Programme (“Member Organisations”)
 
The Safe Sport Programme prescribes:  
 
* Case Management -  an independent mechanism to receive, respond and resolve reports of concern. This includes the investigations by the case management unit of the Safe Sport Commission and adjudication by an independently appointed Safe Sport Disciplinary Panel
* Process and Procedures - clear rules and guidelines on assessment and investigation of reports of concern, a decision-making framework for the determination of severity and consequence(s)
* Measures – protective and/or rehabilitative interventions including education, contact limitations and re-integration programmes  
* Sanctions – limitations, conditions, suspensions or denial of the privilege of participation as a consequence for engaging in Misconduct 
 
 
The Safe Sport Programme supports Member Organisations through: 
* Policymaking – development of safeguarding policies that incorporate the Unified Code and other best practices; access to safeguarding tool kits and risk and needs assessment frameworks
* Training and Education – for stakeholders through access to curriculum and advocacy materials for safeguarding officers and participants
* Access to system for secure record-keeping and confidential reporting of incidents
* Facilitating support for affected parties who require augmented psychosocial support
* Accreditation – through a Safe Sport Safety Mark upon the implementation of the relevant safeguards
