### The Safe Sport Programme
 
The Safe Sport Programme comprises all the elements required to optimize the implementation of the Unified Code for sporting organisations that subscribe to the Safe Sport Programme (“Member Organisations”).

The Safe Sport Programme supports Member Organisations through: 

* **Policymaking** – assistance with the development of safeguarding policies that incorporate the Unified Code and other best practices; access to safeguarding tool kits and risk and needs assessment frameworks <br><br>
* **Training and Education** – for stakeholders through access to curriculum and advocacy materials for safeguarding officers and participants <br><br>
* **Case Management Service** - an independent mechanism to receive, respond and resolve reports of concern. This includes the investigations by the case management unit of the Safe Sport Commission and where necessary are resolved though adjudication by an independently appointed Safe Sport Disciplinary Panel. <br><br>
* **Access to systems** for secure record-keeping and confidential reporting of incident. <br><br>
* **Facilitating support** for affected parties who require augmented psychosocial support through a network of befrienders and counsellor <br><br>
* **Accreditation** through a Safe Sport Safety Mark upon the implementation of the relevant safeguards

 <br><br>
The Safe Sport Programme also prescribes:
* **Process and Procedures** - clear guidelines on jurisdiction, confidentiality, assessment and
investigation of reports of concern, a decision-making framework for the determination of severity and consequence(s) and hearing procedures which will ensure a consistent, fair and independent resolution process. <br><br>
* **Measures** – protective and/or rehabilitative interventions including education, contact limitations
and re-integration programmes.<br><br>
* **Sanctions** – appropriate limitations, conditions, suspensions or denial of the privilege of
participation as a consequence for engaging in Misconduct.
