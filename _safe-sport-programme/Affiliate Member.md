			<td> Onboarding Session </td>
			<td> This in-person session will be used to review the results of the risk assessment exercise. The session will be facilitated by the Safe Sport Commission and attended by the key personnel of the organisation (e.g., staff who oversees the policy direction and management).</td>
			</tr>
		<tr>
			<td> Stage 3 </td>
			<td> Developing a Safe Sport Policy </td>

			<td> Key stakeholders (e.g., coaches, staff, athletes, parents, volunteers) can undergo training/workshop sessions to increase their <a href="https://www.safesport.sg/training-and-education/awareness-module/">awareness of Safe Sport</a>.<br><br>Organisations can also send representatives to be trained as a <a href="https://www.safesport.sg/training-and-education/so-training/">Safeguarding Officer</a>.<br></td>
