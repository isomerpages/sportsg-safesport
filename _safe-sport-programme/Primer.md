##### Why Safe Sport is important 

Inappropriate behaviour in the community affects enjoyment and participation in sport at all levels. If left unaddressed, will:<br><br>
* **compromise the safety and well-being of affected persons** which can have lifelong impact or worse, cause life threatening situations. This is especially grave when those concerned are minors, the vulnerable or persons with disabilities in our community <br><br>
* **allow fractures to develop within the community** when disputes are not managed well, or at all, by the
organisations responsible. This often results in disclosures through other channels which opens the issues up to the court of public opinion in which factions may emerge<br><br>
* **create a culture of permissibility**, whether real or perceived, and the manifestation of negative habits and
norms within sport overtime which may culminate into disciplinary issues or crimes<br><br>
* **result in disillusionment** by concerned parties of the systems in place to protect them and hold persons
responsible which may lead to departure from those communities or sport altogether<br><br>
* **damage the trust, goodwill and confidence** people have in the integrity of sport

<b>ENVIRONMENTAL RISK FACTORS IN SPORT</b><br>
<li>inherent trust and power imbalance in favour of persons regarded to be persons of
knowledge or authority in an environment that is generally perceived as safe</li>

environment where there is a heavy emphasis on winning</li>
<li> lack of oversight and/or checks on poor organisational culture that tolerate poor practices</li>
<li> little and/or lack of knowledge and requirements for organisational safeguarding policies and
training amongst sport coaching and instruction with differing accreditations</li> 
<li> little and/or lack of awareness, and in turn demand from sport participants for such
qualifications when engaging instructional services.</li></div>
