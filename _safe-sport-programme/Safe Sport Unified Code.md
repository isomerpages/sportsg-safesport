### The Safe Sport Unified Code

The Unified Code is the cornerstone of the Safe Sport Programme and sets out a unified reference for the Singapore sporting community that describes the forms of abuse and harassment which may take place in the sporting environment (“Misconduct”).

The Unified Code may be adopted by any organisation by reference to the Unified Code in its member protection policies.
