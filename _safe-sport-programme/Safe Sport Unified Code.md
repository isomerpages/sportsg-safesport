### **The Safe Sport Unified Code**

The Unified Code was launched on 23 November 2021. It is the cornerstone of the Safe Sport Programme and sets out a unified reference for the Singapore sporting community that defines, describes and explains the forms of abuse and harassment which may take place in the sporting environment.
