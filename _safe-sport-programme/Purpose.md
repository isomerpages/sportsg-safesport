The purpose of the Safe Sport Unified Code and the Safe Sport Programme which supports it are:
* to safeguard participants in the sporting environment from abuse and harassment which undermine both the mental and physical health of participants and the integrity of sport
* to ensure harmonised and coordinated safeguarding framework across the Singapore sporting ecosystem through organisations that are responsible for organising, administering and facilitating participation in sport 

Whilst guided by international frameworks on safeguarding in sport, the Safe Sport Unified Code and Safe Sport Programme have been contextualised for Singapore sporting landscape and the sporting community through extensive consultations with sporting community stakeholders. 

Together, the Safe Sport Unified Code and the Safe Sport Programme form the national framework for safeguarding in sport.
