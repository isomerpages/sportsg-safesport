This helps to relieve the administrative burden on organisations and gives assurance to affected parties and respondents that reports will be managed fairly and independently.






#### 3Rs -  Receiving, Responding and Resolving



##### Receiving
Anyone can make a Disclosure or a Formal Report related to incidents of harrassment or abuse.

A Disclosure happens when a person wishes to seek support or is unsure of his/her experience. Subject to mandatory reporting laws, a Disclosure does not trigger a formal process. A person may elect to turn a Disclosure into a Formal Report any point. 

A Formal Report takes place where a report provider would like for an incident to be assessed and investigated.


##### Responding

Depending on whether a Disclosure or a Formal Report has been made, the Case Management Unit will proceed to:
* refer the affected party to  augmented [support services](/case-management/support-network), where appropriate
* conduct a preliminary assessment to determine if there is breach of the Unified Code on the face of the evidence
* commence a formal investigation to determine if Misconduct has taken place


##### Resolving

Resolution may take many forms and is specific to:
* the needs and the value of the different outcomes for the affected party
* the severity of the Misconduct which is unique to the circumstances of each incident  


[Safe Sport Programme Handbook](/files/Safe%20Sport%20Programme%20Handbook%20101.pdf) 

Clear process and procedures are set out in the rules of the Safe Sport Programme Handbook which include:
* timelines and procedures to ensure due process for all parties
* a decision-making framework
* independent adjudication by a Safe Sport Disciplinary Panel, where the severity of the Misconduct is moderate or severe
