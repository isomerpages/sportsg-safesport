<h4><strong>3Rs - Receiving, Responding and Resolving</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>Receiving</strong></h5>
<p>Anyone can make a Disclosure or a Formal Report related to incidents of
harrassment or abuse.</p>
<p>A Disclosure happens when a person wishes to seek support or is unsure
of his/her experience. Subject to mandatory reporting laws, a Disclosure
does not trigger a formal process. A person may elect to turn a Disclosure
into a Formal Report any point.</p>
<p>A Formal Report takes place where a report provider would like for an
incident to be assessed and investigated.</p>
<h5><strong>Responding</strong></h5>
<p>Depending on whether a Disclosure or a Formal Report has been made, the
Case Management Unit will proceed to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>refer the affected party to augmented <a href="https://www.safesport.sg/case-management/support-network" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">support services</a>,
where appropriate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>conduct a preliminary assessment to determine if there is breach of the
Unified Code on the face of the evidence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>commence a formal investigation to determine if Misconduct has taken place</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Resolving</strong></h5>
<p>Resolution may take many forms and is specific to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>the needs and the value of the different outcomes for the affected party</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the severity of the Misconduct which is unique to the circumstances of
each incident</p>
</li>
</ul>
