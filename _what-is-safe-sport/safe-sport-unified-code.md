## Safe Sport Unified Code

The Unified Code is a document that will harmonise organisational rules regarding Safe Sport in Singapore. It is
seen as a new standard applicable across sports
and for the industry which will:
1. Educate all stakeholders on what is
considered appropriate and inappropriate
behaviours, especially for ‘grey’ areas

2. Clearly state the avenues and process for
anyone who wants to make a report of
concern.
