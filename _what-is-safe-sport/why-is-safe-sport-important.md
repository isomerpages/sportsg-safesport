**Why is Safe Sport important?  **

All participants in sport, including athletes, coaches, officials and volunteers, have a right to engage in Safe Sport. In 2018, Sport Singapore (SportSG) embarked on a multi-agency collaborative effort by launching the Safe Sport Commission and made a rallying call for the sporting fraternity to collectively safeguard sport.

 

In consultation with the International Olympic Committee and local authorities, SportSG and the Safe Sport Commission has developed policies and guidelines aimed towards eradicating harassment and abuse in sport. This includes establishing a reporting process for Safe Sport-related matters and providing awareness programmes to ensure the public is kept informed and updated of the available support.

 

“We recognise the importance of creating a safe sporting environment. This is a responsibility shared by all members of the sporting fraternity and the Safe Sport Commission will continue to work with SportSG to strengthen its Safe Sport framework, policies and processes. Together, we can achieve a safe and abuse-free sporting environment for all in Singapore.” said Ms Chan Yen San, Chairman of the Safe Sport Commission.
