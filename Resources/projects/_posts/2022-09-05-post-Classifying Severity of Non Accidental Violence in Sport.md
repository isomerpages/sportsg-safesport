<br><br>Together with the input of over 40 experts from child protection, sexual abuse case managers, sport psychology practitioners and stakeholders in the sporting community, the Safe Sport Commission has developed a set of Classification Guidelines for determining the severity of non-accidental violence.

Severity and/or seriousness is measured based on the degree of culpability relating to abusive behaviour and degree of harm caused to the affected party. 


##### **Documentation**

* [Classification Guidelines](/files/Guidelines%20for%20the%20Classification%20of%20Severity%20of%20Non-accidental%20Violence%20in%20Sport_Brief.pdf) 

* [Full Paper](/files/Guidelines%20for%20the%20Classification%20of%20Severity%20of%20Non-accidental%20Violence%20in%20Sport_Full.pdf)  - including a description of the background, rationale, process and list of contributors.


##### **Purpose**

Classification of severity is necessary for:

* recognising the psychological impact of non-accidental violence on affected parties;

* introducing interventions such as provision of psychosocial support

* raising awareness about the long-term effects non-accidental violence

* supplementing disciplinary process  

The [effects of abuse and harassment](https://stillmed.olympic.org/media/Document%20Library/OlympicOrg/IOC/What-We-Do/Protecting-Clean-Athletes/Safeguarding/IOC-Consensus-Statement_Harassment-and-abuse-in-sport-2016.pdf) in sport can stay with the Affected Party long after incidents have happened, sometimes even resulting in Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).

When “fault” is objectively measured and harm caused is recognised, this not only informs accountability but provides a basis to extend the appropriate level of psychological support to the Affected Party.
